How to Install
==============

Asset Library (recommended)
---------------------------

The easiest way to install NumDot is through the asset library. In the Editor, click the ``AssetLib`` tab at the top. Search for ``NumDot`` and click ``Download``.

Note that new versions may be available on the asset store a few days later than by manual download.

You can also find the entry online: `NumDot on the Godot Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3351>`_.

Manual Download
---------------

You can manually download the `latest release <https://github.com/Ivorforce/NumDot/releases>`__ from GitHub.
To install, simply unzip the archive and place the files into your Godot project.

Custom Build
------------

You may want to manually build NumDot, for example to:

- **Reduce Build Size:** The default NumDot build is fairly large. You can compile it with fewer features to reduce the binary size.
- **Adjust Optimization Options:** You can optimize your build for different targets, e.g. speed, size and compatibility.
- **Custom Extension:** You can extend NumDot's functionality by interfacing with `xtensor <http://xtensor.readthedocs.io>`__ directly, substantially improving performance of individual computations.
