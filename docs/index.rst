Introduction
============================

`NumDot <https://github.com/Ivorforce/NumDot>`__ is a tensor math and scientific computation library for the `Godot Engine <https://godotengine.org>`__.

NumDot provides a multidimensional array object (:ref:`NDArray <class_NDArray>`) and :ref:`many functions <class_nd>` for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, statistical, and more. It is inspired by the Python tensor math library, `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`__, and thus shares many semantics with it.

Motivation
==========

The NumDot library for Godot Engine is designed to make scientific and mathematical computations fast and easy using GDScript. Here are some reasons why you may want to consider using NumDot:

- **Performance**: NumDot is optimized for handling performance-intensive mathematical operations.
- **Convenience**: NumDot reduces the need for complex, hard to understand code by providing comprehensive mathematical functions.
- **Ease of Use**: User-friendly design simplifies complex mathematical tasks.
- **Consistency**: NumDot ensures accurate calculations consistent with NumPy.
- **Educational Benefit**: NumDot facilitates learning and teaching mathematical concepts within Godot.

In short, NumDot bridges the gap between high-level GDScript programming and efficient mathematical computations, enhancing both the development process and the final product.
