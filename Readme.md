# NumDot

A tensor math and scientific computation library for the [Godot](https://godotengine.org) game engine. The project is still in its early stages. [Contributions are welcome](https://github.com/Ivorforce/NumDot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

NumDot is inspired by the python tensor math library, [NumPy](https://numpy.org), and uses [xtensor](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor) under the hood.
